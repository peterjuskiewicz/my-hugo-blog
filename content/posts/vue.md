## Vue.js

Vue.js is a JavaScript framework for building website interfaces. It's easy to start with and can be added to projects bit by bit. Vue uses templates and a virtual DOM (a lightweight copy of the real page) to show things on screen efficiently. It has a system of reusable components, making code organized. While Vue mainly handles what users see, it works well with other tools for things like managing data or page navigation. It's known for being easy to learn, flexible, and fast, making it popular for all kinds of projects.
