## Domain Name

A domain name is a human-readable address used to identify a specific location on the internet, making it easier to access websites and online services. It translates to an IP address, which is a numerical identifier used by computers to locate and connect to servers. A domain name consists of two main parts: the second-level domain (e.g., "example" in "example.com") and the top-level domain (e.g., ".com"). Domain names are managed by domain name registrars and are essential for establishing a web presence, providing a user-friendly way to navigate to websites instead of using numeric IP addresses.
